### Employee responsibilities in the OSS project

Open-source projects are typically developed by volunteers who contribute their time and expertise. As such, all contributors must understand their responsibilities and how they can best contribute to the project.

Here are some of the critical responsibilities of open-source contributors:

* **Contribute code:** This is the most obvious responsibility of open-source contributors. Contributors should review the project's code and identify areas to improve. They should then submit pull requests with their changes.

* **Test code:** Contributors should also test the project's code to ensure it works properly. This can be done by running unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
* **Document code:** Contributors should also document the project's code so that other contributors can understand how it works. This can be done by writing comments in the code, creating documentation, and writing blog posts.
* **Answer questions:** Contributors should be willing to answer questions from other contributors about the project. This can be done on the project's mailing list, forums, or chat room.
* **Promote the project:** Contributors should also promote the project to others. This can be done by writing blog posts, giving presentations, and speaking at conferences.

By fulfilling these responsibilities, open-source contributors can help to make the project more successful.
