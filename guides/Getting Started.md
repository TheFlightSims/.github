## Open-source standards

Our standard project is the repository that contains the following:

* Linked into at least 01 license. This license may not TheFlightSims standard license (e.g. MIT License, GNU GPL 3.0, Creative Commons).
* Clear instructions in source codes and readme documents, including how computers behave at some points.
* Opening for anyone to report their issues on the issues page.
* Protect main branches (note that a project can contain multiple branches), requiring administrators to merge these branches.
* Wikis well-explained how the application behaves to new users.

In an open-source project, each part of the source code is divided equally into folders or branches. Sometimes, you must read the instructions carefully to manipulate your ideas into the project.

Typically, a contribution instruction contains these guides:

* Front-end development guide, including CLI/GUI instruction.
* Back-end development guide, including security and code connectors.

Most of the instructions can be seen as follows:

* Repository `README.md`.
* Repository folder: `help`, `guide`, `pictures`.
* Project wiki page.
* Sometimes, you can see them on our public webpage.
