### OSS licenses

OSS Licenses allow contributors and developers can use, manipulate, deploy, and integrate source code into applications without permission from TheFlightSims and other contributors.

There are ***2*** types of OSS licenses provided by TheFlightSims:

* **Self-hosting project by TheFlightSims**: This license allows you can redistribute and modify it. However, please note that if any vulnerability is found on the project, we can *revoke*, *limit access*, or even *delete the repository*.

* **Community-hosted project**: This license allows you can redistribute and modify it, but we cannot do any manipulation without permission from the community. We still can store and administer it, but the proper consent is from the district.

### Closed-source licenses

Closed-source licenses are limited in source code manipulation. Customers and Developers must read the terms and conditions carefully for each one.

#### License for freeware

The same between all licenses mentioned below is restricted in *profit-making, source code access, debugging, and disassembly* with the free license.

All other differences between the free license:

* ***Personal*** only allows for **individual** use. That means deploying application and services for third-party is **NOT ALLOWED**.

* ***Education*** allows all permission in the *Personal* license + research. Students and Researchers can use it for their research programs. However, deploying applications and services for third-party is **NOT ALLOWED**.

* ***Enterprise*** allows all permission in the *Education* license. However, deploying applications and services for third-party is **ALLOWED**, but you cannot profit from them.

#### License for payware

The same between all licenses mentioned below is allowed in *profit-making* but still restricted in *source code access, debugging, and disassembly* with the payware license.

All other differences between the free license:

* ***Personal*** only allows for individual use. That means deploying applications and services for third-party is **NOT ALLOWED**.

* ***Education*** allows all permission in the *Personal* license + research. Students and Researchers can use it for their research programs. However, deploying applications and services for third-party is **NOT ALLOWED**.

* ***Enterprise*** allows all permission in the *Education* license. However, deploying applications and services for third-party is **ALLOWED**.
