# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: August 4, 2025*

At TheFlightSims, we do a simple privacy policy statement for public users: **We do not collect your data**, including your downloads, your IP addresses, or any other information that could identify you on the Internet.

For employees, the Virtual Identity System (VID) protects your real-life identity. The collector at sign-in is only for troubleshooting and helps prevent unauthorized access.
