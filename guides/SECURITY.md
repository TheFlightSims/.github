# Security

TheFlightSims takes the security responsibilities  of our software products and services seriously, including all open-source software and close-source software

## Reporting Security Issues

**Note:** You shouldn't report the security vulnerabilities on Issue page, or on the public place. Any attackers can use these vulnerabilities to exploit non-public data - which causes the mass problems then.

You can report the security issues on these platforms:

* [Discord]() (Direct Message is recommended)
* The repository security page (Prefered)
* [Email](mailto:theflightsimulations@gmail.com) 


If you prefer to report using email, we recommend encrypting your message with our PGP key; please download it from the [Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/pgp-key-msrc).

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.


# Preferred Languages
