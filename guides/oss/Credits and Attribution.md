# Credits and Attribution

To record your attribution, you have to contribute to our projects. You can do the following steps:

* Contribute your code or bug fixes
* Report a problem, including the mistake in coding and wikis
* Suggest new idea

By default, your work will automatically be recorded by GitHub or our automatic system. However, if you don't see you on the credits/attribution list, you may need to contact us to solve this problem.

In this case, please clearly write down:

* Your contribution record (may include your codebase)
* Your valid personal/work email and a linked GitHub account with that email
